What is the use of transistors and how computers work?

Transistors are semi-condctors. However, they can be made as fully conducting current by a technic called dopining. when, other imputies are add to it using some voltage they will release electron and be able to move current. Hence, they can be used as a switch to turn on and off the current. the two state is usually reprsented as binalry in computer (thir use in modern comuter (0 and 1). Therfore, by switching the transistors we can tell our computers what to do. Actually, there is a lowlevel a translator or standard code (ASCII and T- that translate what we input to the computers.
what is moor's Law?
Mores law state that as we get efficent in puting many trnsostors in a small space, the efficenney of our machine increases and theire size decreases hence, the price of the macinens get chepaer. This has been the case over past years. The capacity of today's cellphone for instance is many fold of old big and giaginatic machines. at the same time the price is loa andaffordable to many. 
what is Lambda Calculus and its application in computing?
